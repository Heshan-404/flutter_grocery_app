This is another Flutter application I built as a learning exercise.

## What I Learned

Building this "Awesome Places" app focused on exploring fundamental UI and navigation patterns in Flutter:

* **Mastering Page Navigation with `Navigator`:**
    * This project gave me hands-on experience with Flutter's `Navigator` widget for transitioning between different screens or "pages" within the application.
    * I learned how to push new routes onto the navigation stack to move forward and pop routes to go back, creating a seamless user experience.

* **Displaying Internet Images with `Image.network`:**
    * I explored fetching and displaying images directly from the internet using the `Image.network` widget.
    * I gained an understanding of how to handle asynchronous image loading and display remote assets effectively within the app.

* **Layering Widgets with the `Stack` Widget:**
    * This project allowed me to delve into the powerful `Stack` widget, which enables layering widgets on top of each other.
    * I learned how to position widgets within the stack using properties like `Positioned`, allowing for complex UI layouts where elements overlap. This is useful for things like placing text over images or creating card-like effects.
