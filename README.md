## Grocery App

This is a Flutter application I built as a learning exercise, expanding on my previous Block app.

## What I Learned

Building this "Grocery App" helped me deepen my understanding of Flutter and explore more advanced concepts, particularly around code organization and reusable components:

* **Improved Folder Structure:**
    * I explored best practices for structuring Flutter projects, organizing my code into logical folders for better maintainability.
    * I learned to separate UI components, business logic, and assets into distinct folders.

* **Advanced Custom Widgets:**
    * **Reusable Widgets:** I gained more practice building highly reusable custom widgets, suitable for use throughout the app.
    * I moved beyond basic text and image props. I started building widgets with different input types like boolean for switches or data objects.
    * **Shared Widgets:** I identified and created shared widgets - common components like buttons, text fields, or card layouts - that are used in various parts of the app. This reduces redundancy.

* **Buttons with Linear Gradients:**
    * I explored using `LinearGradient` to enhance the visual appeal of buttons.
    * I learned to control the colors, angle, and stops of a linear gradient to create custom button styles.

* **Advanced Widget Customization:**
    * I became more comfortable with the use of different properties of widgets such as `decoration` property to add `BorderRadius` to containers.
